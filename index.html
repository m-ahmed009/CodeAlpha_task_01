                                    <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15
                                        team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in
                                        the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the
                                        number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During
                                        2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament.
                                        In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test
                                        batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all
                                        three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first
                                        player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli
                                        made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for
                                        T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the
                                        captain of the Test team as well.</p>
                                    <p>He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was
                                        recognized as the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir

                                        occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test
                                        Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the
                                        first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he was named the
                                        Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to
                                        2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013,
